Exercise 4a Bonus: Your own texture and further considerations
--------------------------------------------------------------

***Problems of pattern-based texturing***
- Too repetitive: we can easily detect some geometrical redonduncies within
the texture due to the fact that a single pattern is used.
- Mapping on free-form shapes:
  -Problems at poles
  -Distorsions
- Flat texturing: no visual illusion of a 3D texture

***Solutions of pattern-based texturing***
- To avoid repetitivity, distorsion and poles problems in mapping: 
  use of isotropic textures (patches that fit to themselves) [NeyretCani99]
  use hierarchical local mapping [Soler Cani Angelidis 02]
  use 3D textures: volume of material embedding the object (no mapping to 
  compute). The texture can be created using Perlin's noise, for example.

- To avoid flat texturing:
  use bump mapping: perturbation of the normal (using Perlin noise, for example)
  to give an illusion of relief (but the geometry of faces did not change).
  use voxels in 3D geometry, mapped on a surface like texture patterns
